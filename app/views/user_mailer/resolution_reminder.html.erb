    <h1>Hey <%= @user.username %>!</h1>
    <p>
      This is to remind you to work on your <%= @resolution.name %> resolution
      <br />
    </p>
    <% if @resolution.goals.blank? %>
    <p>
      Looks like your resolution is incomplete but you don't have any active goals.
      Go make some for your '<%= @resolution.name %>' resolution or mark it as complete.
    </p>
    <% else %>
    <p>
      Remember to work specifically on:
      <% @resolution.goals.each do |goal| %>
      <ul>
        <li><%= goal.name %> </li>
      </ul>
      <% end %>
    </p>
    <% end %>
    <p>Thanks for using the app and have a great day!</p>
